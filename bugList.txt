    .html complete, no bugs found.

    Several bugs found on the second revision. In the .html code, inside the
step-row div, I had progress as a class and not an id. Also, the div closing
element was under the three step-col classes.

    In the styles.css I was missing the entire style for .container form 
    making my app not show the step the user is currently on.
